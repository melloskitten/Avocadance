 # Always Start Small First 🎼  !
 
 First, we will start with the easiest song (Twinkle Twinkle Little Star ⭐) and then gradually try out all the options.
 
 ## Instructions
 - Circles and rectangle shapes (also called **rhythms**) move from the top of the screen slowly downwards.
 - Tap on one of the four corresponding blue rectangles (also called **rhythm panels**) at the lower half of the game screen ***when*** a rhythm is directly in the center of it. This may sound harder than it is, but as soon as you hear the music, it will be super easy to do! 🕺💃
 - The circle shaped rhythms are called **Tap Rhythms**. Just simply tap when one of them is aligned on a rhythm panel.
 - The rectangle shaped rhythms are called **Slide Rhythms**. When one of these figures arrives, make sure to hold your finger when it arrives, and let it go when the slider ends.
 - You collect points when you tap or slide a rhythm at the correct time!
 
 ## Let the dancing begin! 🕺💃🎼

 ## Let's dance with somebody else! 🐱🐧
 Do you want to check out the other dancers? Simply change `withDancer: .avocado` to something else and ▶️ again!
