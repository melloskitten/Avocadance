 ## About Me
 
 Hello there, my name is **Sandra Grujovic** and I'm a 22 year old M.Sc. Computer Science student from Germany 👩‍💻. Have fun with 🥑🐱🐧! All graphics used in this playground have been drawn by me. ❤️

 ## The Story
 *Mr. Avocado* and his friends *Mama Cat* and *Pinguino the Kidd* are huge fans of dancing. Recently, Mr. Avocado decided to dig deeper into the wonderful world of classical music. Mama Cat and Pinguino the Kidd are curious - they may not know too know much about Mozart, Bach and Beethoven, but they're dance moves is amazing! ⭐
 
 Together, they decide to practice their dancing skills on  **classical** music! 🎼
