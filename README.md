### Avocadance is an interactive Swift playground submission for my WWDC 18 scholarship. 
It's a rhythm-based mini game with cute characters and classical music. All art is drawn by me. 

If you want to see how it looks like in action, check out the youtube video [here](https://youtu.be/4VQUpnFYjmE).

__Update:__ I won the scholarship! (´・ω・`)
